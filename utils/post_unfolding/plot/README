For a list of options, run ./plot_unfolded_EBS_BandUP.py --help

    Since the plotting tol has a lot of different options, 
    I've written a graphical user interface (GUI) to it:
        plotting_tool_GUI/BandUP_plot_GUI.pyw

    The GUI requires that you have PyQt4 in you python installation.
    If, for some reason, you cannot use the it, you can keep using 
    the plotting tool in the command line, just as usual.
