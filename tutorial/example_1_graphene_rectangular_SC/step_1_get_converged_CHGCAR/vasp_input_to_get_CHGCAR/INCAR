 SYSTEM = Graphene - Self Consistent calculation

 Flags which affect the runtime for parallel jobs (and don't change the results)
   ALGO = Fast ! A faily robust mixture of both IALGO=38 and IALGO=48   
   LPLANE = .TRUE.
   NSIM = 1  ! NSIM bands are optimized at the same time, if IALGO = 48.

 Start parameter for this Run:
   ISTART = 0  ! job   : 0-new  1-cont  2-samecut
   ICHARG = 2  ! charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const
   LWAVE  = F  ! Write or not WAVECAR
   LCHARG = T  ! Write CHGCAR

 Electronic Relaxation
   EDIFF =  1E-6
   NELMIN = 8 ! do a minimum of eight electronic steps
   ENCUT = 400.000
   ENAUG = 644.873
   LMAXMIX = 4

 Ionic Relaxation
   IBRION = -1 ! No update. Ions are not moved. 
   ISIF = 2
   NSW = 0

 DOS related values
   ISMEAR = -5

 Evaluate projections operators in real-space or in reciprocal space
   LREAL = Auto  ! Projection done in real space, with fully automatic optimization of projection operators. Do not use for small cells.

 Precision
   PREC = Normal
