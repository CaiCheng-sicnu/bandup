Go through steps 1-5, and execute the scripts in each folder.
You might need to adapt some of them to your own computer/environment.

* Another even simpler case you can try is, for instance, an NxN graphene SC, with N = 1, 2, 3, ...
  We haven't included such examples in the tutorial because: 
      (i)   The current example is a bit more general (PC and SC have different symmetries)
      (ii)  The results would be quite redundant anyway.

Let us know if you have problems!
