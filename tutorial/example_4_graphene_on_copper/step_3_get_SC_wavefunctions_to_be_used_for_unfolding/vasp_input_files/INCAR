 SYSTEM = Graphene@Cu(111) - non SC run for BandUP

 Flags which affect the runtime for parallel jobs (and don't change the results)
   ALGO = Fast
   LPLANE = .TRUE.
   NSIM = 1  ! NSIM bands are optimized at the same time, if IALGO = 48.
   NPAR = 17 ! Switch on/off parallelization (and data distribution) over bands. Number of nodes working on each band: total_number_of_nodes/NPAR

 Start parameter for this Run:
   ISTART = 0  ! job   : 0-new  1-cont  2-samecut
   ICHARG = 11  ! charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const
   LWAVE  = T  ! Do/do not write WAVECAR
   LCHARG = F  ! Do not write CHGCAR
   ISYM = 0

 Electronic Relaxation
   LREAL = Auto
   ENCUT = 500.000
   ENAUG = 644.873
   LMAXMIX = 4 ! Controls up to which l quantum number the onsite PAW charge densities are passed through the charge density mixer and written to the CHGCAR f
ile
   EDIFF =  1E-5

 Ionic Relaxation
   IBRION = -1
   ISIF = 2
   NSW=0

 Monopole, Dipole and Quadrupole corrections
   IDIPOL = 3       ! Monopole/dipole and quadrupole corrections for the total energy
   LDIPOL = .TRUE.  ! Potential correction mode
   DIPOL = 0.5 0.5 0.5  ! Center of mass of cell (in direct, fractional coordinates)

 DOS and Band Structure related values
   ISMEAR = 0 ! Gaussian smearing
   SIGMA = 0.025
   LORBIT=11 ! Write the DOSCAR and lm decomposed PROCAR files

 Precision
   PREC = Normal
