 SYSTEM = Graphene@Cu(111) - E0

 Flags which affect the runtime for parallel jobs (and don't change the results)
   ALGO = Fast ! A faily robust mixture of both IALGO=38 and IALGO=48   
   LPLANE = .TRUE.
   NSIM = 1  ! NSIM bands are optimized at the same time, if IALGO = 48.
   NPAR = 12 ! Switch on/off parallelization (and data distribution) over bands. Number of nodes working on each band: total_number_of_nodes/NPAR

 Start parameter for this Run:
   ISTART = 0  ! job   : 0-new  1-cont  2-samecut
   ICHARG = 2  ! charge: 1-file 2-atom 10-const
   LWAVE  = F  ! Write or not WAVECAR
   LCHARG = T  ! Write CHGCAR

 Electronic Relaxation
   EDIFF =  1E-5
   NELMIN = 8 ! do a minimum of eight electronic steps
   ENCUT = 500.000
   ENAUG = 644.873
   LMAXMIX = 4 ! Controls up to which l quantum number the onsite PAW charge densities are passed through the charge density mixer and written to the CHGCAR file

 vdW settings
   LUSE_VDW = .TRUE.
   AGGAC = 0.0000    ! Removing PBE correlation correction, since only LDA correlation is used in the vdW-DF functionals
   GGA = MK          ! selects the optB86b exchange functional
   PARAM1 = 0.1234   ! parameters for the optB86b exchange functional
   PARAM2 = 1.0000   ! parameters for the optB86b exchange functional

 Ionic Relaxation
   IBRION = -1 ! No update. Ions are not moved. 
   ISIF = 2
   NSW = 0

 DOS related values
   ISMEAR = -5  ! Tetrahedron method with Blochl corrections (use a Gamma-centered k-mesh)
   LORBIT=11 ! Write the DOSCAR and lm decomposed PROCAR files

 Evaluate projections operators in real-space or in reciprocal space
   LREAL = Auto  ! Projection done in real space, with fully automatic optimization of projection operators. Do not use for small cells.

 Monopole, Dipole and Quadrupole corrections
   IDIPOL = 3       ! Monopole/dipole and quadrupole corrections for the total energy. The dipole moment will be calculated only parallel to the direction of the 3rd vector.
   LDIPOL = .TRUE.  ! Potential correction mode. A linear electrostatic potential is added to the local potential, correcting the errors introduced by the PBC.
   DIPOL = 0.50000   0.50000   0.50000 ! Cell's center of mass (in direct, fractional coordinates). Should be set if LDIPOL = .TRUE. is used.

 Precision
   PREC = Accurate
