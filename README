Plane-wave codes currently supported by BandUP
======================================================================================
    * At the moment, BandUP can parse wavefunctions generated by: 
        * VASP
        * Quantum ESPRESSO
    * Do contact me if you would like to have support to the pw code you use. 
        * As usual, I'll do my best to help you out.
        * Of course, you can also collaborate by writing/sending me a routine to read 
          the wavefunctions produced by your code. If you already have a routine, then
          we'd only need to write an interface to it :)

======================================================================================
How to compile BandUP
======================================================================================
    * To compile BandUP, run the "build.sh" script: ./build.sh
    * A folder named "BandUP_bin" will be created.
        * You'll find the executable for BandUP in it.
    * This should work in most Unix environments with Intel compilers installed. 
        * Do check, however, the system requirements below if you have any problem.


======================================================================================
System requirements:
======================================================================================
    * Preferably Linux
        * Might work in other environments based on Unix
    * Fortran 90 and C compilers
        * Preferably Intel compilers (ifort and icc), version 12.1.4 (or higher)
    * Python 2.7 (or higher) for the post-processing utilities
        * You will need to have the following packages installed 
          (you probably already have most of them):
            * numpy 
            * scipy
            * matplotlib
            * argparse
            * heapq
        * Please let me know if I've forgotten to list any other package!
    * Optional: PyQt4
            * PyQt4 is needed only if you want to use the graphical user interface 
              (GUI) version of the plotting tool.
            * If the GUI doesn't work with you, you can keep using the plotting tool 
              in the command line, just as usual.
            


======================================================================================
Tips:
======================================================================================
    * It might be handy to include the BandUP_bin folder in your PATH. By doing so,
      you'll be able to use BandUP in whataver folder you're working at.
    * BandUP accepts some optional command line arguments and flags. To know them, 
      run the code with the flag '-help'.
    * Since the plotting tool has a lot of different options, I've given it a GUI:
          utils/post_unfolding/plot/plotting_tool_GUI/BandUP_plot_GUI.pyw
      You'll find a symlink to it (bandup_plot) in the BandUP_bin folder.
      * The GUI requires that you have PyQt4 in you python install.
      * If you move the BandUP_plot_GUI.pyw file, move the BandUP_plot_GUI.ui too.



======================================================================================
Please mind that:
======================================================================================
    * If you use BandUP (or any part of it) in your work, please state that you've
      used the BandUP code (or a modified version fo it), and read and cite our paper: 
                     >>> Phys. Rev. B 89, 041407(R) (2014).

    * Additionally, if you perform unfolding along with calculations employing spinor 
      eigenstates (noncollinear magnetism, spin-orbit coupling, etc), then you should
      also read and cite our paper that describes the methodology used:
         >>> arXiv:1409.5343, Submitted (2014) <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5343>

    * Although I've tried to make the compilation as simple as possible - and it has 
      indeed worked fine so far with many combinations of compilers, computers, and 
      operating systems, I cannot guarantee that it will always work smoothly. 
      You might eventually need to play a bit with the scripts and, very rarely, 
      with the Makefiles and source code.
    * In the calculations and tests I've performed with BandUP so far, I've basically 
      used intel compilers (v. 12.1.4). I *believe* that you should have no problems 
      using other versions of ifort/icc (and *maybe* even other non-intel compilers), 
      but I cannot, unfortunatelly, guarantee that it will work in 100% of the cases.
    * Of course, I'll try my best to help you out in case you do have problems.
    * The support to two-component spinor-like wavefunctions is still under test.
    * Last, but not least: Always check the results with a critical eye, specially 
      if they don't look the way you think they are supposed to. Please notify me if 
      weird stuff happens and you think it's the code's fault!
 

Have fun! 
Let us know if you have problems!
