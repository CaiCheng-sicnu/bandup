How to compile BandUP
===================================================================================
    * To compile BandUP, run the "build.sh" script: ./build.sh
    * A folder named "BandUP_bin" will be created.
        * You'll find the executable for BandUP in it.
    * This should work in most Unix environments with Intel compilers installed. 
        * Do check, however, the system requirements below if you have any problem.


===================================================================================
System requirements:
===================================================================================
    * Preferably Linux
        * I've also had success with Mac OS X
        * Might work in other environments based on Unix
    * Fortran 90 and C compilers
        * Preferably Intel compilers (ifort and icc), version 12.1.4 (or higher)
    * Python 2.7 (or higher) for the post-processing utilities
        * You will need to have the following packages installed 
          (you probably already have most of them):
            * numpy 
            * scipy
            * math
            * matplotlib
            * argparse
            * heapq
        * Please let me know if I've forgotten to list any other package!
            


===================================================================================
Please mind that:
===================================================================================
    * Although I've tried to make the compilation as simple as possible - and it has 
      indeed worked fine so far with many combinations of compilers, computers, and 
      operating systems, I cannot guarantee that it will always work smoothly. 
      You might eventually need to play a bit with the scripts, and, very rarely, 
      with the Makefiles and source code.
    * In the calculations and tests I've performed with BandUP so far, I've basically 
      used intel compilers (v. 12.1.4). I *believe* that you should have no problems 
      using other versions of ifort/icc (and *maybe* even other non-intel compilers), 
      but I cannot, unfortunatelly, guarantee that it will work in 100% of the cases.
    * Of course, I'll try my best to help you out in case you do have problems.

Let us know if you have problems!
